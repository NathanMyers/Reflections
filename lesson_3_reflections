When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project with multiple people or when you want to share a project with other people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you can copy someone else's project or code without changing the original. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone : By cloning a repository, you download the whole repository with dotfiles (like .git, .gitignore etc.) to your local computer.

Fork : By forking a repository, you just virtually create a “copy” of the main repository to your account. Forks are usually useful in creating Pull Request(s) to the main repository.

Branch is something that is within a repository. Conceptually, it represents a thread of development. You usually have a master branch, but you may also have a branch where you are working on some feature xyz, and another one to fix bug abc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If something breaks or there is a bug after a commit there is still a copy stored locally.
