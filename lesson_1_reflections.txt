How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Using diff helped narrow down the differences between the files
quickly instead having to slowly read through each file and compare. It was much faster and easier to go through a 10 - 15 lines than a thousand.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It can help you look at changes and see either where you departed from the original plan or view any changes that broke the code in the first place. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manual commits give you more control, but are prone to errors. Google docs saves commits when it might not be logical to do so and so you end up with many more files than you need. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

With bigger projects it allows us to track changes and break things into smaller pieces. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control allows you to take more risk without having to worry about completely breaking the project or system because you can always revert back to the last working version.  

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Keeping track of changes of my code and looking at the codebase of previous projects.
